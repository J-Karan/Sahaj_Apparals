# Sahaj Apparels Backend Project

Welcome to the Sahaj Apparels Clothing Company Backend Project!

This GitHub repository hosts the back-end implementation for Sahaj Apparels, a leading clothing company. Our back-end infrastructure is developed using Java, incorporating JSP (JavaServer Pages) and Servlets, and relies on MySQL for robust database management. For enhanced security, we've implemented password encryption using Argon2d through the Password4j library.
